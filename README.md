# workflow-automation-scripts
Some examples of scripts that I use. 
The old AutoHotkey scripts are using version 1. Now i only use the new ahk version, 2. They have some differences in syntax and stuff. 

## down up press
Makes a key send a keypress on both down and back up actions. 

## chrome cast uncast shortcut
I always have youtube on my first chrome tab. This script can:
1. go to that tab, cast screen to my chromecast, press play and make it fullscreen. starts chrome if it's not already open. 
2. stop casting, press pause, switch to last tab, then go to desktop. 
3. go to first tab, press play/pause, then alt-tab.
